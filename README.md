# Heart-Disease-Classification
Model to predict if a person suffers from heart disease or not using K-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm.

## How the code works?
1. Load the heart disease dataset from Kaggel, with 300+ instances and 14 features.
2. Clean and preprocess the data values.
3. Data visualization to find number of instances in each class.
4. Find the best value of K for the dataset.
5. Use the best K-value to make predictions on testing data.


## File wise explanation:
* Heart Disease Classification Using KNN.ipynb : to clean, preprocess, analyse, visualize and build model for the data.
* heart.csv : file containing data values.
